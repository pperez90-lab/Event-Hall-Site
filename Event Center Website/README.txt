Soulstice Music Hall Website Project
====================================

Overview
--------
This project is a multi-page website for a fictional event center, "Soulstice Music Hall," based in Porto. The site simulates a real-world digital presence for a modern concert and event venue, letting visitors explore upcoming events, learn about the space and team, submit booking inquiries, and get in touch. My goal was to bring together all my knowledge so far—semantic HTML, CSS layout, responsive design, and interactivity—to create a compelling, professional, and usable site.

Pages & Structure
-----------------
- index.html      -- Home page with hero/banner, featured highlights
- about.html      -- About page (venue history, mission, and team)
- events.html     -- Events page listing schedule (table) and featured event cards (CSS grid)
- booking.html    -- Booking request/contact form page
- contact.html    -- Contact form, location, and info

All pages include:
- Semantic HTML tags: header, nav, main, section, article, footer, etc.
- A sticky navigation menu linking all pages.
- Headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists where appropriate.
- At least one table (event listing on Events page).
- Multiple images (.jpg, .png) with descriptive alt text.
- Internal navigation and external links (social media, bookings).
- A contact form (name, email, textarea/message, and submit).
- A footer with social media links and copyright.
- Mobile-friendly, responsive layout (including hamburger menu for small screens).

Styling & Approach
------------------
- Used an external CSS file ('styles.css').
- Established a consistent color scheme (black, white, gold/yellow highlights) and modern typography.
- Used Flexbox and CSS Grid for page and component layouts.
- All sections utilize hover and focus effects for interactivity.
- Banner area uses a cycling background with animated opacity for a premium, concert-venue feel.
- At least one ID selector and multiple class selectors per CSS requirements.
- All forms styled with custom buttons, spacing, and visual clarity.
- Fully responsive: header becomes sticky, nav collapses to hamburger menu, and all main cards/sections restyle for mobile devices.
- Transitions and box-shadows included for visual polish.
- "Back to Top" button appears on scroll for improved usability.

Bonus Features
--------------
- CSS transitions and subtle animations enhance event cards, hero section, and navigation.
- Favicon included.
- Modern gallery-style event cards and a call-to-action-driven layout.

What I Learned
--------------
Building this site, I practiced:
- Organizing multi-page projects for clarity and maintainability.
- Using modern, semantic HTML structure for accessibility and SEO.
- Advanced CSS for layout (grid, flex), effects (shadows, overlays, transitions), and media queries.
- Implementing interactive JS for background cycling and responsive navigation.

How to Use
----------
1. Open any of the HTML files in your browser. Start with 'index.html'.
2. Explore navigation, try resizing the page or using a mobile device.
3. Submit forms and interact with all sections for a realistic event center experience.
