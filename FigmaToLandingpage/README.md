🚀 Peter Perez Portfolio Landing Page

Welcome! This is my fully responsive personal landing page, reimagined from a Figma portfolio template and crafted in HTML and CSS. My site showcases my work, background, and experience as a customer service leader, podcaster, and developer, now based in Porto, Portugal.

💡 About This Project

Transforming a Figma template into my own portfolio site was a hands-on way to flex front-end development skills and build a professional web presence tailored to my personal brand. Every detail—from navigation, layout, and color to logo grid and “About Me” blurb—has been customized to reflect both my journey and my technical abilities.
